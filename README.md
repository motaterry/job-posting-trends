# Job Posting Trends

This project aims to create a simple web page that visualizes job posting trends over time. It includes a filtering mechanism to view trends for specific job titles. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and leverages Chart.js for data visualization.

"Job Posting Trends" is a powerful tool for gathering insightful information about career projections. By considering geographic factors and historical patterns, users can make informed decisions about their career paths. This project helps identify high-demand job titles in various locations and understand how these trends have evolved over time. Whether you're a job seeker looking to move to a new city, a student planning your future career, or an employer analyzing the job market, this tool provides valuable data to support your decisions.
